# Computationally Reproducible FC/dFC Workflow for Psychedelic Resting-State fMRI

#### Author: Yu-kan Fan (范育康）

---

This repository develops a computationally reproducible workflow for static functional connectivity (FC) and dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis of resting-state fMRI data from the PsiConnect dataset. At the current stage, the project focuses on workflow construction and pilot-run validation, not group-level inference about psychedelic-related effects.

The long-term goal is to compare static FC and dFC features to evaluate whether dynamic connectivity measures provide complementary information beyond traditional static connectivity analyses.

**Final course presentation slides are available in `doc/final_presentation.pdf`.**

## Scope

Here, **reproducible** refers to computational reproducibility:

```text
same derivatives + same code + same parameters → same outputs
```

The current repository does not yet establish external replication, generalizability to other datasets, or group-level psychedelic-related effects.

## Research Questions

Current workflow-focused questions:
- Can we build a documented and computationally reproducible FC/dFC workflow for the PsiConnect fMRIPrep derivatives?
- Can the workflow generate ROI time series, static FC matrices, and sliding-window dFC summaries from one pilot run?
- After scaling up, can FC/dFC features be compared across sessions or psychedelic-related conditions?

# Dataset

The analysis uses an open neuroimaging dataset from **OpenNeuro**.

Dataset: PsiConnect  
Accession: ds006110  
Source: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds006110  

This project focuses only on the resting-state fMRI derivatives from the PsiConnect dataset.

The full dataset is **not included in this repository** because neuroimaging files are large. Users should access the original dataset through OpenNeuro and DataLad.

# Dataset Availability

Full fMRIPrep derivatives were verified in the local DataLad file tree. The dataset includes resting-state preprocessed BOLD images and corresponding confound regressors, including MNI152NLin2009cAsym-space outputs:

```text
*_task-rest_*space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz
*_task-rest_*desc-confounds_timeseries.tsv
*_task-rest_*space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_desc-brain_mask.nii.gz
```

This confirms that the dataset can support resting-state functional connectivity and dynamic functional connectivity analyses, pending further quality control and selective download/readability checks for git-annexed files.

# Current Project Status

Completed so far:

- Inspected fMRIPrep derivatives and generated a resting-state file index.
- Matched resting-state BOLD images, confounds files, and brain masks across runs.
- Verified 127 runs with matched BOLD/confounds/mask files.
- Processed one full pilot run.
- Generated pilot ROI time series, static FC, and sliding-window dFC outputs.

Confirmed resting-state fMRIPrep derivatives:

| File type | Count |
|---|---:|
| MNI-space preprocessed resting-state BOLD | 127 |
| Resting-state confounds TSV | 127 |
| MNI-space brain masks | 127 |
| All task-rest derivative files | 5877 |

Session-level coverage:

| Session | Rest MNI BOLD | Confounds TSV |
|---|---:|---:|
| ses-01 | 65 | 65 |
| ses-02 | 62 | 62 |

Summary:

```text
BOLD/confounds count match: YES
BOLD/mask count match: YES
FC/dFC pipeline feasibility: YES
```

A resting-state file index has also been generated:

```text
outputs/file_index/rest_file_index.csv
```

This file index contains subject/session-level paths for BOLD images, confounds files, and brain masks. It will serve as the input table for QC, ROI time-series extraction, static FC, and dynamic FC analyses.

# Analysis Pipeline

<div align="center">

---

The analysis workflow consists of the following steps:

1. Dataset inspection and BIDS/fMRIPrep structure verification
2. Resting-state file index generation
3. BOLD/confounds/mask quality control
4. ROI parcellation using a preliminary grid atlas, with planned replacement by a standard atlas such as Schaefer 100/200
5. ROI time-series extraction
6. Static functional connectivity estimation
7. Sliding-window dynamic functional connectivity estimation
8. Extraction of dynamic network features
9. Comparison between static and dynamic connectivity measures

## Interim Pilot Results

To show what the workflow yields, I applied the current pipeline to one pilot resting-state run:

```text
sub-PC001 / ses-01 / task-rest / run-1
```

These results are intended as **workflow-validation outputs**, not as evidence for psychedelic-related effects or group-level findings.

### Pilot output summary

| Output | Result |
|---|---:|
| ROI time-series matrix | 504 × 67 |
| Static FC matrix | 67 × 67 |
| Sliding-window FC matrices | 45 |
| Mean edge dFC variability | 0.361 |
| Max edge dFC variability | 0.653 |

A machine-readable summary of the pilot run is available at `outputs/pilot_summary.csv`.

**Figure:** Static FC matrices from the pilot run. The left panel shows raw Pearson correlation values, and the right panel shows Fisher z-transformed FC values. The diagonal is masked for visualization.

### Static FC Descriptive Checks

</div>

**Figure:** Static FC sanity checks, including the distribution of pairwise FC values and mean connectivity strength by ROI. These plots are not interpreted as ROI-level neurobiological findings.

### Dynamic Functional Connectivity

Dynamic FC was estimated using a sliding-window approach. The pilot run was divided into 45 overlapping windows. For each window, a Fisher z-transformed FC matrix was computed.

![dFC mean connectivity trajectory](figures/pilot_dfc_mean_connectivity_trajectory.png)

**Figure:** Mean Fisher z-transformed FC across sliding windows. The shaded region indicates ±1 SD across edges within each window.

![dFC variability matrix](figures/pilot_dfc_variability_matrix.png)

**Figure:** Edge-wise dFC variability matrix. Brighter values indicate ROI-to-ROI connections with greater temporal fluctuation across windows.

![Window-to-window FC similarity](figures/pilot_window_to_window_fc_similarity.png)

**Figure:** Window-to-window FC pattern similarity matrix. Higher values indicate more similar whole-matrix FC configurations between windows.

### Interpretation

These interim results show that the workflow can generate ROI time series, static FC, and sliding-window dFC outputs from fMRIPrep derivatives. At this stage, the outputs validate the computational workflow only. They do not support claims about psychedelic-related effects, session differences, or group-level neural mechanisms.

## Usage

### 1. Check dataset availability

```bash
python src/check_dataset.py --data-dir /path/to/ds006110
```

### 2. Build resting-state file index

```bash
python src/build_file_index.py --data-dir /path/to/ds006110
```

This generates:

```text
outputs/file_index/rest_file_index.csv
```

## Reproducing Pilot Figures

The pilot figures were generated using:

```text
pilot_figure_generation.ipynb
```

When running the notebook in Google Colab, upload the following derived pilot outputs when prompted:

1. `sub-PC001_ses-01_task-rest_run-1_roi_timeseries_z.csv`
2. `sub-PC001_ses-01_task-rest_run-1_static_fc.csv`
3. `sub-PC001_ses-01_task-rest_run-1_static_fc_fisher_z.csv`
4. `fc_dfc.zip`

The `fc_dfc.zip` file should contain 45 Fisher z-transformed sliding-window FC matrices matching:

```text
sub-PC001_ses-01_task-rest_run-1_window-*_fc_fisher_z.csv
```

## Current Limitations

- One pilot run has been processed so far.
- The current atlas is a preliminary grid-based atlas.
- Motion and nuisance control are not finalized.
- No group-level inference has been performed.
- The exact experimental meaning of `ses-01` and `ses-02` still needs to be confirmed from dataset documentation or associated publications.
- Reproducibility here refers to computational reproducibility only, not external replication.

## Next Steps

- Scale the workflow to all 127 matched resting-state runs.
- Replace the preliminary grid atlas with a standard atlas such as Schaefer 100/200.
- Strengthen motion and nuisance regression.
- Link imaging runs with session-level or condition-level metadata.
- Compare FC/dFC features across sessions or conditions after metadata linkage.

# Computationally Reproducible FC/dFC Workflow for Psychedelic Resting-State fMRI
(original: Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Psychedelic-Induced Altered States of Consciousness)

Institution: National Taiwan University

This repository develops a computationally reproducible workflow for static functional connectivity (FC) and dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis of resting-state fMRI data from the PsiConnect dataset. At the current stage, the project focuses on workflow construction and pilot-run validation, not group-level inference about psychedelic-related effects.

The main goal is to compare **static functional connectivity (FC)** and **dynamic functional connectivity (dFC)** to determine whether dynamic connectivity measures provide additional information beyond traditional static connectivity analyses.

## scope
The current repository does not yet establish external replication, generalizability to other datasets, or group-level psychedelic-related effects.

## Research Questions

Current workflow-focused questions:
- Can we build a documented and computationally reproducible FC/dFC workflow for the PsiConnect fMRIPrep derivatives?
- Can the workflow generate ROI time series, static FC matrices, and sliding-window dFC summaries from one pilot run?
- After scaling up, can FC/dFC features be compared across sessions or psychedelic-related conditions?

# Dataset

The analysis uses an open neuroimaging dataset from **OpenNeuro**.

Dataset: PsiConnect  
Accession: ds006110  
Source: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds006110  

Key features of the dataset include:

This project focuses only on the resting-state fMRI derivatives from the PsiConnect dataset.

The full dataset is **not included in this repository** because neuroimaging files are large. Users should access the original dataset through OpenNeuro and DataLad.

# Dataset Availability Update

Full fMRIPrep derivatives were verified in the local DataLad file tree. The dataset includes resting-state preprocessed BOLD images and corresponding confound regressors, including MNI152NLin2009cAsym-space outputs:

```text
*_task-rest_*space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz
*_task-rest_*desc-confounds_timeseries.tsv
*_task-rest_*space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_desc-brain_mask.nii.gz
```

This confirms that the dataset can support resting-state functional connectivity and dynamic functional connectivity analyses, pending further quality control and selective download/readability checks for git-annexed files.

# Current Project Status

Completed so far:

- Inspected fMRIPrep derivatives and generated a resting-state file index.
- Matched resting-state BOLD images, confounds files, and brain masks across runs.
- Verified 127 runs with matched BOLD/confounds/mask files.
- Processed one full pilot run.
- Generated pilot ROI time series, static FC, and sliding-window dFC outputs.

Confirmed resting-state fMRIPrep derivatives:

| File type | Count |
|---|---:|
| MNI-space preprocessed resting-state BOLD | 127 |
| Resting-state confounds TSV | 127 |
| MNI-space brain masks | 127 |
| All task-rest derivative files | 5877 |

Session-level coverage:

| Session | Rest MNI BOLD | Confounds TSV |
|---|---:|---:|
| ses-01 | 65 | 65 |
| ses-02 | 62 | 62 |

Summary:

```text
BOLD/confounds count match: YES
BOLD/mask count match: YES
FC/dFC pipeline feasibility: YES
```

A resting-state file index has also been generated:

```text
outputs/file_index/rest_file_index.csv
```

This file index contains subject/session-level paths for BOLD images, confounds files, and brain masks. It will serve as the input table for future QC, ROI time-series extraction, static FC, and dynamic FC analyses.

# Analysis Pipeline

![analysis pipeline](analysispipeline.png)

The planned analysis pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. Dataset inspection and BIDS/fMRIPrep structure verification
2. Resting-state file index generation
3. BOLD/confounds/mask quality control
4. ROI parcellation using a standard brain atlas
5. ROI time-series extraction
6. Static functional connectivity estimation
7. Sliding-window dynamic functional connectivity estimation
8. Extraction of dynamic network features
9. Comparison between static and dynamic connectivity measures

## Interim Pilot Results

To show what the workflow yields, I applied the current pipeline to one pilot resting-state run:

```text
sub-PC001 / ses-01 / task-rest / run-1
```

These results are intended as **workflow-validation outputs**, not as evidence for psychedelic-related effects or group-level findings.

### Pilot Outputs

| Output | Result |
|---|---:|
| ROI time-series matrix | 504 × 67 |
| Static FC matrix | 67 × 67 |
| Sliding-window FC matrices | 45 |
| Mean edge dFC variability | 0.361 |
| Max edge dFC variability | 0.653 |

### ROI Time-Series Extraction

The pilot run produced a 504 × 67 ROI time-series matrix using a preliminary grid-based atlas. ROI signals were z-scored for visualization.

![ROI time-series heatmap](figures/pilot_roi_timeseries_heatmap.png)

**Figure:** **Figure:** ROI time-series heatmaps from the pilot run. The upper panel shows raw ROI signals, and the lower panel shows z-scored ROI signals. Rows correspond to ROIs and columns correspond to time points.

This heatmap verifies that ROI time-series extraction produced a usable matrix for downstream FC/dFC analysis.

### Static Functional Connectivity

Pairwise Pearson correlations were computed across the full resting-state run, producing a 67 × 67 static FC matrix.

![Static FC matrix](figures/pilot_static_fc_fisher_z_matrix.png)

**Figure:** Static FC matrices from the pilot run. The left panel shows raw Pearson correlation values, and the right panel shows Fisher z-transformed FC values. The diagonal is masked for visualization.

This output serves as a static reference before dynamic FC estimation.
Fisher z-transformed FC matrices are also generated for downstream statistical analysis.

### Static FC Descriptive Checks

![Static FC descriptive checks](figures/pilot_static_fc_descriptive_checks.png)

These plots were used as sanity checks to inspect the distribution of static FC values and ROI-level mean connectivity. They are not interpreted as ROI-level neurobiological findings.

## Dynamic Functional Connectivity

Dynamic FC was estimated using a sliding-window approach. The pilot run was divided into 45 overlapping windows. For each window, a Fisher z-transformed FC matrix was computed.
The dFC outputs include:

1. **Window-level mean FC trajectory**: average FC across ROI pairs within each window.
2. **Edge-wise dFC variability**: standard deviation of each ROI-to-ROI connection across windows.
3. **Window-to-window FC similarity**: similarity between whole-matrix FC patterns across windows.

### Dynamic FC 1: Window-Level Summary

Using a sliding-window approach, the pilot run was divided into 45 overlapping windows. For each window, a Fisher z-transformed FC matrix was computed.

![dFC mean connectivity trajectory](figures/pilot_dfc_mean_connectivity_trajectory.png)

**Figure:** Mean Fisher z-transformed FC across sliding windows. The shaded region indicates ±1 SD across edges within each window.

### Dynamic FC 2: Edge-Level Variability

Edge-wise dFC variability was computed as the standard deviation of each ROI-to-ROI connection across the 45 sliding windows.

![dFC variability matrix](figures/pilot_dfc_variability_matrix.png)

**Figure:** Edge-wise dFC variability matrix. Brighter values indicate ROI-to-ROI connections with greater temporal fluctuation across windows.

### Dynamic FC 3: Pattern-Level Similarity

For each sliding window, the upper triangle of the FC matrix was vectorized into an edge vector. Window-to-window similarity was computed as the correlation between these edge vectors.

![Window-to-window FC similarity](figures/pilot_window_to_window_fc_similarity.png)

**Figure:** Window-to-window FC pattern similarity matrix. Higher values indicate more similar whole-matrix FC configurations between windows.



### Interpretation

These interim results show that the workflow can generate ROI time series, static FC, and sliding-window dFC outputs from fMRIPrep derivatives. At this stage, the results validate the computational workflow only. They do not support claims about psychedelic-related effects, session differences, or group-level mechanisms.

# Usage

## 1. Check dataset availability

Run the dataset inspection script:

```bash
python src/check_dataset.py --data-dir /Users/macbookair/ds006110
```

This script checks the availability of resting-state fMRIPrep outputs, including:

- MNI-space preprocessed BOLD files
- Confounds TSV files
- MNI-space brain masks
- Session-level coverage

## 2. Build resting-state file index

Run the file-index generation script:

```bash
python src/build_file_index.py --data-dir /Users/macbookair/ds006110
```

This script generates:

```text
outputs/file_index/rest_file_index.csv
```

The file index includes:

- subject
- session
- task
- run
- MNI-space BOLD path
- confounds path
- brain mask path
- relative paths
- file existence indicators
- readiness for analysis

# Current Limitations

- The exact experimental meaning of `ses-01` and `ses-02` still needs to be confirmed from the dataset documentation or associated publication.
- The current repository has completed dataset inspection and file indexing, but ROI time-series extraction has not yet been implemented.
- Motion and nuisance control are not finalized.
- Static FC and sliding-window dFC analyses are planned but not yet completed.
- Large neuroimaging files are not stored in this GitHub repository.
- Further quality control is required to verify BOLD readability, image dimensions, timepoints, TR, confounds alignment, and motion quality.

---

# Next Steps

The immediate next steps are:

1. Build a BOLD metadata quality-control table.
2. Verify BOLD image readability and metadata.
3. Check whether BOLD timepoints match confounds rows.
4. Confirm the experimental meaning of `ses-01` and `ses-02`.
5. Test ROI time-series extraction for a single subject/session.
6. Compute a single-subject static FC matrix.
7. Implement a simple sliding-window dFC demonstration.

# Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Psychedelic-Induced Altered States of Consciousness

Author: Fan Yu-kang  
Institution: National Taiwan University

This repository develops a reproducible workflow for inspecting and analyzing resting-state fMRI data from the PsiConnect dataset. The project focuses on how psychedelic-associated altered states of consciousness may influence the temporal organization of large-scale brain networks.

The main goal is to compare **static functional connectivity (FC)** and **dynamic functional connectivity (dFC)** to determine whether dynamic connectivity measures provide additional information beyond traditional static connectivity analyses.

This repository is part of a course project focused on **open neuroscience workflows**, including dataset inspection, reproducible pipelines, and open-source neuroimaging analysis.

# Research Questions

This project focuses on three main questions:

- How do psilocybin-associated altered states of consciousness alter resting-state brain connectivity?
- Do brain networks exhibit different **temporal dynamics** across experimental sessions?
- Does **dynamic functional connectivity (dFC)** provide complementary information beyond static FC?

---

# Dataset

The analysis uses an open neuroimaging dataset from **OpenNeuro**.

Dataset: PsiConnect  
Accession: ds006110  
Source: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds006110  

Key features of the dataset include:

- Approximately 65 participants
- Two sessions
- Psilocybin-related experimental design
- Multimodal recordings, including MRI and EEG
- Tasks including resting-state, meditation, music listening, and movie watching

This project focuses on **resting-state fMRI data** to analyze intrinsic brain network dynamics.

The full dataset is **not included in this repository** because neuroimaging files are large. Users should access the original dataset through OpenNeuro and DataLad.

# Dataset Availability Update

Full fMRIPrep derivatives were verified in the local DataLad file tree. The dataset includes resting-state preprocessed BOLD images and corresponding confound regressors, including MNI152NLin2009cAsym-space outputs:

```text
*_task-rest_*space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz
*_task-rest_*desc-confounds_timeseries.tsv
*_task-rest_*space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_desc-brain_mask.nii.gz
```

This confirms that the dataset can support resting-state functional connectivity and dynamic functional connectivity analyses, pending further quality control and selective download/readability checks for git-annexed files.

# Current Project Status

The current version of this repository has completed the initial dataset inspection and file-index generation stages.

Confirmed resting-state fMRIPrep derivatives:

| File type | Count |
|---|---:|
| MNI-space preprocessed resting-state BOLD | 127 |
| Resting-state confounds TSV | 127 |
| MNI-space brain masks | 127 |
| All task-rest derivative files | 5877 |

Session-level coverage:

| Session | Rest MNI BOLD | Confounds TSV |
|---|---:|---:|
| ses-01 | 65 | 65 |
| ses-02 | 62 | 62 |

Summary:

```text
BOLD/confounds count match: YES
BOLD/mask count match: YES
FC/dFC pipeline feasibility: YES
```

A resting-state file index has also been generated:

```text
outputs/file_index/rest_file_index.csv
```

This file index contains subject/session-level paths for BOLD images, confounds files, and brain masks. It will serve as the input table for future QC, ROI time-series extraction, static FC, and dynamic FC analyses.

# Analysis Pipeline

![analysis pipeline](analysispipeline.png)

The planned analysis pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. Dataset inspection and BIDS/fMRIPrep structure verification
2. Resting-state file index generation
3. BOLD/confounds/mask quality control
4. ROI parcellation using a standard brain atlas
5. ROI time-series extraction
6. Static functional connectivity estimation
7. Sliding-window dynamic functional connectivity estimation
8. Extraction of dynamic network features
9. Comparison between static and dynamic connectivity measures

# Usage

## 1. Check dataset availability

Run the dataset inspection script:

```bash
python src/check_dataset.py --data-dir /Users/macbookair/ds006110
```

This script checks the availability of resting-state fMRIPrep outputs, including:

- MNI-space preprocessed BOLD files
- Confounds TSV files
- MNI-space brain masks
- Session-level coverage

## 2. Build resting-state file index

Run the file-index generation script:

```bash
python src/build_file_index.py --data-dir /Users/macbookair/ds006110
```

This script generates:

```text
outputs/file_index/rest_file_index.csv
```

The file index includes:

- subject
- session
- task
- run
- MNI-space BOLD path
- confounds path
- brain mask path
- relative paths
- file existence indicators
- readiness for analysis

# Current Limitations

- The exact experimental meaning of `ses-01` and `ses-02` still needs to be confirmed from the dataset documentation or associated publication.
- The current repository has completed dataset inspection and file indexing, but ROI time-series extraction has not yet been implemented.
- Static FC and sliding-window dFC analyses are planned but not yet completed.
- Large neuroimaging files are not stored in this GitHub repository.
- Further quality control is required to verify BOLD readability, image dimensions, timepoints, TR, confounds alignment, and motion quality.

---

# Next Steps

The immediate next steps are:

1. Build a BOLD metadata quality-control table.
2. Verify BOLD image readability and metadata.
3. Check whether BOLD timepoints match confounds rows.
4. Confirm the experimental meaning of `ses-01` and `ses-02`.
5. Test ROI time-series extraction for a single subject/session.
6. Compute a single-subject static FC matrix.
7. Implement a simple sliding-window dFC demonstration.
